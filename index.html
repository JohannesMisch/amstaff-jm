                    About the American Staffordshire Terrier
                </h2>
                <p class="about">
                    AmStaffs are stocky, muscular bull-type terriers standing 17
                    to 19 inches at the shoulder. The head is broad, the jaws
                    well defined, the cheekbones pronounced, and the dark, round
                    eyes are set wide apart. AmStaff movement is agile and
                    graceful, with a springy gait that advertises the breed’s
                    innate confidence. The stiff, glossy coat comes in many
                    colors and patterns. AmStaffers describe their dogs as
                    keenly aware of their surroundings, game for anything, and
                    lovable “personality dogs” around the house. AmStaffs like
                    mental and physical challenges. They are highly trainable,
                    as their many forays into showbiz suggest.

                <h2 class="head-two">NUTRITION</h2>
                <p class="nutrition">
                    The AmStaff should do well on a high-quality dog food,
                    whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with your
                    veterinarian’s supervision and approval. Any diet should be
                    appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior). Some
                    dogs are prone to getting overweight, so watch your dog’s
                    calorie consumption and weight level. Treats can be an
                    important aid in training, but giving too many can cause
                    obesity. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs,
                    and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any
                    concerns about your dog’s weight or diet. Clean, fresh water
                    should be available at all times.

                <h2 class="head-three">GROOMING</h2>
                <p class="grooming">
                    Taking care of the AmStaff’s short, stiff coat is remarkably
                    easy. A quick once-over with a soft bristle brush every week
                    is usually enough to remove any dirt or other foreign
                    matter. What’s more, a good brushing distributes skin oils
                    throughout the coat to help keep it healthy. If an Am Staff
                    gets into something particularly messy, a bath will probably
                    be called for. Otherwise, bathing can wait until when and if
                    he develops a “doggy” smell. As with all breeds, the
                    AmStaff‘s nails should be trimmed regularly, as overly long
                    nails can be painful and cause the dog problems while
                    walking and running.

                <h2 class="head-four">EXERCISE</h2>
                <p class="exercise">
                    An athletic, energetic dog such as the American
                    Staffordshire Terrier requires a lot of exercise. Leaving
                    the dog out in the yard all day is not the right approach,
                    however: Yes, he can run around, but the AmStaff is a
                    people-oriented dog who thrives when he is made part of the
                    family. Long play sessions with his owner develop his
                    physical and psychological health. In addition, many
                    AmStaffs enjoy taking part in canine sports such as
                    obedience, agility, and dock diving. AmStaffs are even
                    trained in search-and-rescue and excel at it.

                <h2 class="head-five">TRAINING</h2>
                <p class="training">
                    Early socialization and puppy training classes are
                    recommended for all breeds, but given the AmStaff’s strong
                    will, physical strength, and exuberance, they are a
                    necessity. The breed’s intelligence and desire to please
                    make training a fun, easy process. Even so, certain
                    behaviors, such as chewing and digging, may be hard to
                    resolve. It must be noted that dog aggression can develop
                    even in well-socialized Am Staffs; an AmStaff should never
                    under any circumstances be left alone with other dogs.
